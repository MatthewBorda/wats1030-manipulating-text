The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Philosophy (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike
Even though the unix system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Alther that philosophy cant be written down in a single sentance, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among progrma than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX program do quite trivial things in isolation, but combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
